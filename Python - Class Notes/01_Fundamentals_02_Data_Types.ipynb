    "# Basic Syntax And Semantics\n",

    "Python's **syntax** refers to the set of rules and structures that dictate how code is written in the language.

Python uses a combination of English keywords and punctuation symbols to construct valid expressions and statements\n",

    "## White Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **whitespace** refers to spaces, tabs, and newline characters that are used for formatting and structuring the code. White space assist with determining the structure and readability of Python programs. Unlike some other programming languages, Python uses whitespace for indentation and block delineation, which affects how code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indentation**: Used to define blocks of code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space in expressions**: Separates elements in a block of an expression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blank lines**: used to separate blocks of code for better readability\n",
    "\n",
    "## INDENTATIONS vs. TABS\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **indentation** to define blocks of code, such as those inside loops, conditionals(if/else), functions, and classes. Python relies heavily on  whitespace to determine the control flow structure of an application. As control structures are introduced, we will revisit the indentation rules. Consistent and proper indentation is crucial for the program's functionality. When creating \"White Space\" using the space bar is preferred over “Tab”  indentation method.  Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comments** are used to explain and label Python code and will be ignored by the Python interpreter.  They are use to provide more information about the functionally of the code and ultimately to make Python code more human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comments assist with **collaboration and ease of use** allowing other users or developer edit your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comments can also be used to prevent execution when testing code. If you are troubleshooting your code, you can use comment blocks to organize the flow of execution so that you can identify run time errors or incorrect logic.\n"
