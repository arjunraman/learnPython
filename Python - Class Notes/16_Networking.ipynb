    "- **Client**: Depending on the context, it can be either the device or the application (i.e. a web browser) being used to connect to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stream Socket**: Performs like streams of information. There are no record lengths or character boundaries between data, so communicating processes must agree on their own mechanisms for distinguishing information (i.e. connection oriented). Stream sockets are most common because the burden of transferring the data reliably is handled by TCP/IP, rather than by the application.\n",

    "- **Datagram Socket**: The datagram socket is a connectionless service. Datagrams are sent as independent packets. The service provides no guarantees. Data can be lost or duplicated, and datagrams can arrive out of order. The size of a datagram is limited to the size able to be sent in a single transaction.\n",

    "\n",
    "|Method | Explanation |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| `.accept()` | Accepts a connection. The socket must be bound to an address and listening for connections. The return value is a pair (conn, address) where conn is a new socket object usable to send and receive data on the connection, and address is the address bound to the socket on the other end of the connection.|\n",
    "|`.bind(address)`| Bind the socket to address. The socket must not already be bound.|\n",
    "|`.close()`|Mark the socket closed. The remote end will receive no more data (after queued data is flushed).|\n",
    "|`.connect(address)`|Connect to a remote socket at address.|\n",
    "|`.listen()`|Enables server to accept connections|\n",
    "|`.recv(bufsize)`|Receive data from the socket. The return value is a bytes object representing the data received. The maximum amount of data to be received at once is specified by bufsize. This is a synchronous function.|\n",
    "|`.recvfrom(bufsize)`|Receive data from the socket. The return value is a pair (bytes, address) where bytes is a bytes object representing the data received and address is the address of the socket sending the data. This is a synchronous function.|\n",
    "|`.send(bytes)`|TCP Method. Sends data to the socket. The socket must be connected to the remote socket.|\n",
    "|`.sendall(bytes)`|TCP Method. Unlike send(), this method continues to send data from bytes until either all data has been sent or an error occurs. None is returned on success.|\n",
    "|`.sendto(bytes, address)`|UDP Method. Sends data to the socket. The socket should not be connected to a remote socket, since the destination is specified by address.|\n",
    "|`socket.socket(family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_STREAM, proto=0, fileno=None)`|The Socket Object. Described in the next section|\n"

    "\n",
    "1. The address family (`AF_*` constants) indicates the protocol used. AF_UNIX is used for interprocess communication. AF_INET and AF_INET6 for IPv4 and v6, respectively. This parameter loosely corresponds to the link and internet layers. For our course, we will only concern ourselves with IPv4 sockets, the default choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. type (`SOCK_*` constants) indicates whether the socket will be streaming or datagram based (`SOCK_STREAM`, `SOCK_DGRAM`). This parameter loosely corresponds to the transport layer protocol. TCP vs UDP. SOCK_STREAM IS TCP, SOCK_DGRAM is UDP. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We will be using the `proto` and `fileno` default values and they can be ignored. `proto` is an option to change to a different protocol family, and `fileno` is a method of feeding in the socket information through a file descriptor.\n",
