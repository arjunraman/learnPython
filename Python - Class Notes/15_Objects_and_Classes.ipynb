    "- The model stresses that the object is a happy amalgam of data and procedure, often expressed as object attributes and object behaviors.\n",
    "- **Object attributes** are coded as Python names bound to values.\n",
    "- **Object behaviors** are coded as Python functions (called methods in OO-speak).\n",
    "- The OO methodology calls for breaking problems into code modules (objects!) that represent things (entities) in the problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The different modules (each one representing something) communicate with each other during the app’s execution.\n",
    "- One module may send a message to another module which may cause the other module to react (execute a method corresponding to a behavior) which may change data in the object and/or send a message to another object, and so one.\n",
    "- The objects changing their data, executing methods in accordance to their designed behaviors result in an end state of the completion of the application’s work (the reason the app was developed in the first place).\n",

    "- As mentioned above all classes inherit from the built-in class ```object```. This means that every class has all the attributes and methods that ```object``` has.  We can choose to overwrite the inherited attributes and methods by implementing our own version.  We see in the two previous examples that we overwrote some inherited magic methods by implementing our own versions.\n",
    "- Besides inheriting from the built-in class ```object```, we can inherit from any class we want.  To do this in our class declaration we include parentheses after the class name and before the colon.  Inside the parentheses we type the name of the class we want our class to inherit from.\n",
